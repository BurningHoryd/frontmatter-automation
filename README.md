# Frontmatter Autogen

An Obsidian plugin that analyzes note content and automatically generates and updates title, summary, and tags in the frontmatter.
Inline tags (#tag) are extracted from the body, removed, and merged into the frontmatter tags.
Supports multi-language tagging rules.


## ‚ú® Features

- Generates title and summary

- Creates tags per language (with quotas and rules)

- Merges existing frontmatter tags + inline tags + AI tags (duplicates removed)

- Adds fm_created (today‚Äôs date) to indicate when frontmatter was updated

- Works with any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint


## üì¶ Installation

### Manual installation (development)

Clone this repo into your Obsidian vault‚Äôs plugin folder
Example: <vault>/.obsidian/plugins/frontmatter-generator

## üîç Workflow

- Split note into frontmatter and body

- Extract inline tags (#tag) from the body

- Clean up the body (remove images, code blocks, length limit)

- Send prompt to LLM (JSON format)

- Receive title, summary, and tags_by_lang

- Merge existing FM tags + inline tags + AI tags (deduped)

- Normalize created / add fm_created

- Write updated frontmatter + cleaned body back to the file


## üß™ Example

Input (body excerpt):
```md
# My Note
This note is about important historical changes in society.
#history #world
```

AI Suggested Tags:
```json
{
  "en": ["CivilRights", "Revolution"],
  "ko": ["ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÏó≠ÏÇ¨"]
}
```

Final Output (frontmatter):
```yaml
---
title: My Note
summary: A short summary generated from the note body.
tags:
  - History        # from inline
  - World          # from inline
  - CivilRights    # from AI (English tags are normalized to PascalCase)
  - Revolution     # from AI
  - ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÏó≠ÏÇ¨         # from AI
created: 2025-08-18
fm_created: 2025-08-18
---
```

## üëâ Note

Final tags always include inline tags, existing frontmatter tags, and AI-generated tags, with duplicates removed.

English AI tags are normalized to PascalCase (e.g., civil rights ‚Üí CivilRights) for consistency.

Tags in other languages follow their own formatting rules (e.g., Korean tags are concatenated without spaces).


## üõ† Troubleshooting

‚ÄúAPI key not set‚Äù ‚Üí Enter your API key in settings.

AI call failed (HTTP error) ‚Üí Check API base, model, and API key.

JSON parse failed ‚Üí Your endpoint may not support response_format: { type: "json_object" }. Remove or adjust.


## üîí Privacy & Network Usage

This plugin requires an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) or another compatible provider.
Your notes' content (with images and code truncated) is sent to the configured API endpoint for generating
titles, summaries, and tags.

- **API Key**: You must provide your own API key in the plugin settings.
- **Network use**: Note content is transmitted over the internet to the configured endpoint.
- **Costs**: Depending on your provider‚Äôs pricing, using this plugin may incur costs.
- **Local safety**: Aside from the AI requests, all processing happens locally inside Obsidian.
